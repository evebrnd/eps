          It should be easy to understand and well organized. That way it is easy to implement for you, the organizer/teacher.

              The first step is to give the students a homework exercise. This exercise is designed to prepare the students for the lesson.
              <br />
              Each student will search for three devices inside his/her house and write down the name of the device and its function.
              <br />
              The student will then bring this list to the lesson.

              The teacher will then let the students go through the chapters of the website. For each chapter, there is a little quiz to do, make sure the students do them. The students have around 40 minutes to do this.

              The teacher will separate the class in groups of four and give each group one set of game. The students have around 30 minutes to do this.

              To finish the lesson, the teacher will announce the last homework exercise and wrap up by reflecting on the lesson. The idea is to gather feedback from the students, see if they learned things and if they enjoyed the lesson.

              The last homework exercise is to determine the risks of the devices the student wrote down in the first homework exercise.
              <br />
              The student will use the Privacy Calculator page available on the website to determine the risks of the devices and create a small report about it.
              <br />
              The teacher can create his/her own version of this homework exercise.

              In this activity, we want you to look at smart home devices from two different viewpoints. Start off by discussing how the device is useful for you in your daily life (or for someone you know), what benefits does it have & would you want to live without it? Next, imagine yourself a hacker: how can you exploit the device to make someoneâ€™s life as miserable as possible? How can you deal damage to the company? Or how can you spy on someone? What are the dangers you can think of? Now reflect on how you initially thought of the device, has your opinion changed? What insights have you gained?
