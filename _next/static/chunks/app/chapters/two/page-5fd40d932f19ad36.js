They interviewed eleven people about why they bought IoT devices, what they think about privacy risks, and what they do to keep their privacy safe.

People thought that good performance and compatibility were positive things about these devices.

They found three main worries: data collection, the extent of information gathered, strange device behavior, and violations of personal privacy. They collected over 109,000 reviews from online stores like Target, Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy. They used a list of 53 keywords to find relevant reviews. After their research, they discovered that only about 2% of the reviews mentioned one of the keywords. The device mentioned the most was the Amazon Echo Show, mentioned in 6.1% of reviews. In the end, they found that people who review these devices usually don't talk about privacy and security worries. If they do mention these issues, it's usually about the kind and amount of data that the devices collect.

People's trust in the companies that make the devices, their government, and policies also varies.
